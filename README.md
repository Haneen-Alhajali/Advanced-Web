## 🌟 About the Project
<strong>Village Management System</strong> is designed to manage and display information about various villages, including their demographics, geographical data, and administrative details. The goal is to provide a comprehensive platform to streamline village management and facilitate decision-making processes. 

### Phases Overview:
- **Phase 1**: Frontend Development (Completed) – LocalStorage for managing village data.
- **Phase 2**: Backend Development (Planned) – Integration with Node.js for server-side functionality and future database handling (MongoDB or MySQL).
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features and Data Visualization – Enhanced user interface, interactive elements, and detailed reporting features.
